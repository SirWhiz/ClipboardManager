## Screenshots:

### When we run the application, the list appears empty:
![empty-text-list](screenshots/cm-01.png)
### Then, we copy some text from a website:
![copy-some-text](screenshots/cm-02.png)
### And we see that the text we copied appears in our list:
![the-list-grows](screenshots/cm-03.png)
### As we keep copying text, the list continues to grow:
